For more than a year now I've been working with a Genesis child theme of my own that has Foundation 5 gridding in it - and a few other goodies.

I've also been adding work in two verticals in the tennis industry: clubs and machines.

This version of that child theme is called RacquetPress, and by the end of the year I'll be launching a number of Genesis child themes on racquetpress.com.
